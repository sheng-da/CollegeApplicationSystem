## CollegeApplicationSystem

#### A database class project - CollegeApplicationSystem 2016/12 

We use ERD diagram to help us designing the database and HTML, PHP and MySQL to set up the system.
For the application system, user need to create a new account to login. And then, they can either check 
their past apply record or create a new application. User can submit their application after they fill all 
the info and the information will be stored in database.
For the login credential, we require one pair of information â€“ user name and password to access the website. 
We encrypted password by storing MD5 hashed password rather than the raw text password in the database.
